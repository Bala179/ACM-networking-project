# ACM-networking-project
This is an open project on Computer Networking that I completed with IIT Roorkee ACM Student Chapter, in December 2020.

## Introduction
This project implements a basic Client-Server communication model using C++. Client-Server communication is accomplished by the process of **networking**, which is the process of connecting two or more computers together to share data. In this project, the 'client' application connects to the 'server' application, and this provides a basic interface for two users at both the ends to 'chat' or converse with each other, by sending and receiving messages.

## How to Run
* The 'client.cpp' file should be downloaded to the client computer and the 'server.cpp' file, to the server computer.
* Compile both files (on the Linux terminal), using `g++ -o client client.cpp` and `g++ -o server server.cpp`.
